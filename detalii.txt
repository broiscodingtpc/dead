DEADPEPE ($DEAD) – Whitepaper
👻 TL;DR:
PEPE is dead. We buried him. And now he’s back – as $DEAD. A zombified meme token born on Solana. No utility. No roadmap. No mercy.

💀 1. The Legend of PEPE's Death
PEPE ruled the meme world. But the hype faded, the bags got heavy, and the frogs went silent.
So we did what any true degens would do: killed PEPE, gave him a tombstone, and raised his corpse as a cursed coin — $DEAD.

🧠 2. What Is $DEAD?
$DEAD is a meme token built on the Solana blockchain, made for those who missed the last wave and want to ride a new one… straight from the grave.

Max Supply: 6,666,666

📉 3. Tokenomics
100% Fair Launch

No presale, no VCs, no taxes.

Liquidity burned (or locked, your choice).

100% of supply goes to the community.

📢 4. Marketing Plan ("aka Vibes")
Meme it.

Tweet it.

Telegram it.

Let the internet do the rest.

We’ll spread the undead gospel of $DEAD one shitpost at a time.
Maybe someone makes a game. Maybe not. Doesn’t matter.

No devs, just degenerates.
Pepe isn’t gone. He’s undead.

📜 7. Legal Stuff
This is a meme. Not financial advice. Not a security. Not real.
But maybe… too real.
